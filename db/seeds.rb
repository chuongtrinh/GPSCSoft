# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)

# departments = [{:academic_unit_name => 'Performance Studies', :college => 'Liberal Arts', :previous_state => '1' ,:current_state => '1'},
#               {:academic_unit_name => 'Educational Administration and Human Resource Development', :college => 'Education and Human Development', :previous_state => '1', :current_state => '2'},
#               {:academic_unit_name => 'Biology', :college => 'Science', :previous_state => '1', :current_state => '3'},
#               {:academic_unit_name => 'English', :college => 'Liberal Arts', :previous_state => '1', :current_state => '4'},
